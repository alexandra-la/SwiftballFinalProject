               Created by @reckedmaserati, who goes by Snowglobe Allie on twitter, Fantasy Swiftball is a fantasy league based on Taylor Swift concerts.
                Each concert Taylor Swift changed which outfits she wore along with other elements, such as acoutistic songs that were a surprise each time. Inspired by the discussion
                of hoping certain outfits would appear, Snowglobe Allie created Fantasy Swiftball where people could guess which outfits and other elements would appear during the concert.
                You can learn more about the categories and statistics in the Previous Statistics tab, learn about the most recent show in the Track tab, and enter your guesses in the Enter
                tab! Have fun with it or strategize your guesses its up to you! And don't forget to draw a lucky thirteen on your hand.
